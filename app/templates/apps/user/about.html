        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
        the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
        undoubtable source.
        <br />
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
        Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
        in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
        dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard
        chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
